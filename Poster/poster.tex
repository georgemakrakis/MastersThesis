%% Default mode is landscape, which is what we want, however dvips and
%% a0poster do not quite do the right thing, so we end up with text in
%% landscape style (wide and short) down a portrait page (narrow and
%% long). Printing this onto the a0 printer chops the right hand edge.
%% However, 'psnup' can save the day, reorienting the text so that the
%% poster prints lengthways down an a0 portrait bounding box.

%% [ADS 4-2005] latex --> dvips --> ps2pdf works just fine for me.
%%
%% To preview using xdvi:
%% 
%% $ xdvi -paper 1188x840mm -s 24 -nopostscript poster.dvi
%%
%% To convert dvi to Postscript:
%%
%% $ dvips -Ppdf -G0 -o poster.ps poster.dvi
%%
%% The dvips options are:
%% Ppdf: use the PDF printer configuration file
%% G0  : shift lower characters to higher position 
%%       (splits ligatures when using Times-Roman font)
%%
%% To convert Postscript to PDF:
%%
%% $ pstill -c -giptCQ -w 3368 -h 2378 -o poster.pdf poster.ps
%% ($ pstill -c -iptCQ -w 3225 -h 2378 -o poster.pdf poster.ps)
%%
%% Note that the pstill options are
%% c:  compression (more c's give more compression; up to four)
%% g:  take size from Postscript file
%% p:  include all fonts as partial fonts
%% i:  include all non-standard fonts
%% t:  map graphics transfer functions from PostScript to PDF. 
%% C:  use RGB color map
%% w:  width in points (1/72 inch) for 1188 mm
%% h:  height in points (1/72 inch) for 839 mm
%% Q:  take embedded fonts from PSFonts directory, not Postscript file
%% Note also that the -w and -h options need to be included else
%% some of the Postscript figures may not be displayed (particularly
%% those converted using fig2dev), even if the -g option is specified.
%% Also, the newest version of pstill (1.55.91) does not deal well with 
%% slanted Times Roman font; use italics or the older version (1.55.3).

%% The basic format of the poster is to create text boxes with the
%% various things you want to display.  You can then play around 
%% with how to lay thing out.  In the old version of this template,
%% the content was always provided with alternatives suitable for
%% printing on sheets of paper (resizing fonts, images, etc).  I
%% think that's too confusing to read.  The old layout was:
%%     \ifposter
%%          some poster commands go here
%%     \else
%%          an alternative style here in case you are printing on
%%          regular sheets of paper
%%     \fi
%% One option is to make the entire poster and then wrap it in an \ifposter
%% and then make all the slides separately.  This seems to be easier
%% if your poster is not much like a bunch of 8.5x11 sheet tacked together
%% in the first place.

\begin{itemize}
\item Natural circulation molten salt reactors have two passive feedback mechanisms that must be considered when designing a controller
\item Temperature reactivity caused by heavy-metal thinning and doppler broadening \cite{PetersonMS}
\item Flow reactivity caused by the advection of delayed neutron precursors out of core \cite{CarterPHD}
\end{itemize}

\CHead{Thought Experiment}
Start design process by investigating dynamics associated with anticipated transients:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Natural circulation flow mode
    \item Passive feedback mechanisms
    \item Transport delays
\end{itemize*}\\
Conduct a thought experiment
\begin{itemize*}
    \item Power step increase 
    \item Core set-point instantly equal to heat exchanger power demand
    \item Ideal controller which produces rapid load following and disturbance rejection
\end{itemize*}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.8in]{Thought-1.png}

Immediately, the core produces more power and the heat exchanger rejects more power. This results in a higher flow-rate and a negative flow reactivity insertion

\includegraphics[width=4.8in]{Thought-2.png}

When the hot salt from the core reaches the heat exchanger, the additional power is delivered and the downcomer returns to its normal temperature

\includegraphics[width=4.8in]{Thought-3.png}

When the cold salt from the heat exchanger arrives in the core, this is a positive temperature reactivity insertion, followed by a negative temperature reactivity insertion when the normal temperature salt arrives

    \CHead{Molten Salt Microreactor Control Loop}
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=18in]{Loop.png}

    Typical feedback loop with a pre-filter, with the addition of the passive feedback mechanisms. The core ($\dot{Q}_{Core}$) and heat exchanger ($\dot{Q}_{HEX}$) powers go through the respective temperature dynamics ($G_C$ and $G_H$) and time delays for the riser ($\theta_R$) and downcomer ($\theta_{DC}$) before being converted to reactivity by the temperature($\alpha_T$) and flow ($\alpha_F$) feedback mechanisms. The passive reactivity feedback is combined with the control drum reactivity ($\rho_{CD}$) and fed into the reactor dynamics ($P(s)$).

    \end{center}
    \end{textblock}


\begin{textblock}{10}(12,14.5)
\CHead{Pre-Filter}
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:prefilter}
    F(s)=\frac{1}{\tau_F s+1}    
\end{equation*}

Pre-filters are unity gain transfer functions that provide inertia against rapid changes. A pre-filter that reshapes the core set-point after a change to heat exchanger demand will make the initial hot edge more gradual. This will allow the temperature profile to equilibrate more quickly rather than settling into bi-stable resonance. Proper tuning of the pre-filter time-constant will allow the reactivity oscillations to decay more quickly. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=8in]{Prefilter.png}

\end{textblock}

\begin{textblock}{10}(24,14.5)
\CHead{Dead-band}
A dead-band is a type of piecewise function where the output is null for inputs surrounding zero ($\pm \delta$) but has some other value for inputs with greater magnitude. It is common in thermostatic controls (where the furnace in a home only turns on when the temperature inside is sufficiently far from the setpoint). In process control, it is common for a controller gain ($K_C$) to be dead-banded to avoid swift periodic actuation.

\begin{equation*}
    K_C=
        \begin{cases}
            K_C & \text{if } e < -\delta \\
            0 & \text{if } -\delta < e < \delta \\
            K_C & \text{if } e > \delta 
        \end{cases}
\end{equation*}\\


    Previous work \cite{CarterPHD} has shown that the passive feedback mechanisms (temperature and flow reactivity) are capable of autonomous load following for small transient, though not at the level of performance that may be required in certain applications. Still, this provides the opportunity to minimize fine and rapid actuation while dampening oscillations by using a dead-band; the `ringing out' of minor perturbations could be left to the passive feedback mechanisms after the active feedback controls the bulk of the power change.

\CHead{PID Controller}
The controller output ($u$) is often determined by a PID equation, which considers the instantaneous, cumulative, and predictive error. This equation has three terms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Proportional control term. The control output is manipulated in proportion to the error defined by the proportional gain constant ($K_P$).   
\item Integral control term, which considers the historical cumulative error in an effort to eliminate steady-state offset that a P-Only controller may exhibit. As the process variable settles around the set-point, the cumulative error approaches a constant value and the effect of the integral controller diminishes.
\item Derivative control term, which estimates the time rate of change of the error to dampen overshoot. This mechanism is sometimes referred to as anticipatory control. 
\end{enumerate}

A nuclear reactor is controlled by manipulating the criticality of the core, making it supercritical to increase the power, and subcritical to decrease. This is a highly time dependant exponential control mechanism. The derivative controller time constant will need to be carefully tuned to minimize the likelihood of significant overshoot following a power transient


\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:pid}
    u(t) 
    = \underbrace{K_P e(t)}_{\text{Proportional}} 
    + \underbrace{K_I \int_0^t e(t)dt}_{\text{Integral}} 
    + \underbrace{K_D \frac{de(t)}{dt}}_{\text{Derivative}}
\end{equation*}
\end{textblock}


\begin{textblock}{10}(36,15)
\CHead{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neutronics modeling will be conducted to characterize the actuator-control reactivity curve ($A(s)$)
    \item Finite-element process simulation will be conducted to characterize the heat exchanger ($G_H(s)$), core ($G_C(s)$), and overall reactor ($P(s)$) dynamics
    \item A gain/bias schedule will be developed to account for the fact that more control reactivity is required to make the reactor go critical later in the fuel lifetime
    \item Poison reactivity from the build-up of xenon-135 may be accounted for using a Bode-Step controller \cite{Roberson}
