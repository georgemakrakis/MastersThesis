\chapter{Process Control Engineering}
\label{Chapter:Controls}

There are two main goals in process control engineering:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
    \item Reference tracking, where a process variable is matched to a set-point which may be changed over time; and 
    \item Disturbance rejection, where the process variable is held to the set-point despite outside influence upsetting it;
\end{enumerate*}
This is usually achieved by a controller which detects the process variable using a sensor/transmitter and controls the process variable by manipulating an actuator. 

\section{Feedback}

\section{Feedforward}
The term `Feedforward' can be used to refer to any element in the control block diagram that exists outside of the feedback loop.

\subsection{Disturbance Feedforward}
Not that useful since disturbance transport delay is on the order of minutes and disturbance dynamics are on the order of milliseconds

\subsection{Pre-Filter}
This could be electronic (less ideal) or physically realized by decoupling 


\section{Time Variance}
Fissile depletion - time function parameters or look-up table to gain-schedule and turn the time variant system into a shift invariant system.

In addition to the relatively slow time variance of fissile fuel depletion during steady-state critical operation, there are specific times in a \acs{msnb}'s expected operational life-cycle that exhibit a higher degree of time variance: 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\arabic*)]
\item Start-up; \item Shut-down; and \item Re-start.
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection{Start-up}
Black-start may need to deal with thawing salt - main concern is fission product neutron poison build-up (discuss the burnable poison stuff)

\subsection{Shut-down}
Planned shut-down

Emergency Shutdown/SCRAM(must be passive)

Decay heat and keeping the salt liquid for restart

\subsection{Re-start}
\Xe stripper
