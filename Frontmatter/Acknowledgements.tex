   \chapter{Acknowledgements}
   I am greatly thankful for the exceptional guidance, mentorship, and friendship of Professor McKellar. Each week, I looked forward to our meetings, where his wisdom, reassuring presence, and deep understanding of the intricate mathematics behind thermal fluid systems consistently reinvigorated my enthusiasm towards this research. 

   My committee members played distinct and indispensable roles in the completion of this thesis. Dr. Borrelli's guidance and mentorship over the last 2+ years have been transformative, helping me grow significantly as a researcher. His reliable availability to tackle the challenges of this project was a cornerstone of its success. Dr. Roberson exhibited great patience as I gained intuition in his area of expertise, and provided depth of understanding where mine was rudimentary. 

   This work and my coursework was completed under a Graduate Fellowship funded by \acf{nrc}.
