 To my mother, Tammy, who planted and nurtured my love of science. To my father, coach, foreman, tech support, and \#1 fan, Paul, who kindled my engineering spirit through practical home projects. To my cats, Babe and Bunyan, who stayed up with me all those long nights studying and writing. Thank you for your endless support.\par
