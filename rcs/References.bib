abstract = {The TENDL library is now established as one of the major nuclear data libraries in the world, striving for completeness and quality of nuclear data files for all isotopes, evaluation methods, processing and applied performance. To reach this status, some basic principles have been applied which sets it apart from other libraries: reproducible dedicated evaluations when differential data are available, through determination of nuclear models implemented in TALYS and their parameters, completeness (with or without experimental data), format and processing standardization, automation of production and reproducibility. In this paper, we will outline how such an approach has become a reality, and recall some of the past successes since the first TENDL release in 2008. Next, we will demonstrate the performance of the latest TENDL releases for different application fields, as well as new approaches for uncertainty quantification based on Bayesian inference methods and possible differential and integral adjustments. Also, current limitations of the library performances due to modelling and needs for new and more precise experimental data will be outlined.}
