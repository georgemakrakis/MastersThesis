To my mother, Tammy, who planted and nurtured my love of science. To my father, Paul, who taught me how to design and build, and showed me that I am an engineer. To my cats, Babe and Bunyan, who stayed up with me all those long nights studying and writing. Thank you for your endless support.

I made a second family here in Idaho. From the doldrums of a tough homework problem to the triumph of Borah Peak, you've been by my side. Thank you Arnold, James, Shirley, Drew, Stefan, Dave, Yuling, and Kayla.

Just before I started my graduate studies, I had the privilege of moving into a caring community off of Garfield St. Roy and Travis, Jim and Laura, Bobbi, Seneca and Tyson, and Kevin, thank you for welcoming me into your neighborhood as one of your own.
