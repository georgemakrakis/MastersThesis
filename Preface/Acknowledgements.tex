   {\LARGE\textsc{Acknowledgements}}

   This work and my coursework was completed under a Graduate Fellowship funded by \acf{nrc}. The neutronics modeling was performed through computational resources from the \acf{hpc} Center at \acf{inl}, with assistance from John Koudelka and the \acs{inl} \acs{hpc} support staff.
   
   Professor McKellar has been a great guider in my graduate studies. He has a knack for helping students learn for themselves what he could easily tell them: the work of a true teacher. Dr. Borrelli and Dr. Roberson are a wealth of knowledge in nuclear and electrical engineering. This thesis is built on top of their contributions.
